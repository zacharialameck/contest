			<h1>WE ARE FRIENDS</h1>
			Dear world, my name is Panique Mubikirizo!<br>
come from a country torn by war and from poor family.<br>
At the age of 18 now mature to know almost everything and capable to reason,<br>

People have no mercy on you when you are currying the refugee status.<br>
I pray to people who can to people of good heart and merciful to help refugees wherever there are.<br>
is like jail, like a grave.
Thank you.<br>
